# wms report transfer script

While OCLC is phasing out uploading periodic WMS reports to an SFTP in favor of ad-hoc
reports building, they do plan to continue uploading certain reports on a weekly basis.
After a little bit of setup, this bash script can be used to automate the transfer
from OCLC's SFTP to your own server.

## setup for password-free access

You'll want to either use a prexisting public/private keypair or generate one specifically
for gathering reports.

### A) Generate an SSH keypair

```
$ ssh-keygen
```

**Note:** when creating your keypair, be sure to leave the passphrase blank if you're planning
to automate the report-copying process.

### B) Copy the public file and move it to the SFTP

The SFTP server is quite stripped down as far as what commands can be run (I was only
able to run very basic `ls`, `mkdir`, `rm`, and `chmod` commands, most without the
extra flags needed to accomplish anything worthwhile). I found it easier to make the
changes on my end before placing them on the OCLC server.

```
$ cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/oclc_authorized_keys
$ chmod 640 ~/.ssh/oclc_authorized_keys
$ scp ~/.ssh/oclc_authorized_keys lol@scp.oclc.org:.ssh/authorized_keys
```

**Note:** if you created a separate key, use that name in place of `id_rsa`.

**Another note:** `lol` should be replaced with your library's OCLC symbol.
Unless that _is_ your symbol, in which case, you've officially won.

Enter `yes` to add the SFTP's IP to your list of authorized hosts, then enter your
password.

### C) Give it a whirl

Try running:

```
$ sftp lol@scp.oclc.org
```

If it connects without prompting you for a password, you're all set to go!

## usage

```
$ git clone https://github.com/malantonio/wms-ftp-transfer-script
$ cd wms-ftp-transfer-script
$ OCLC_SYMBOL=lol REPORT_NAME=Overdue_Report OUT_PATH=/path/to/reports/overdue /path/to/get-wms-report.sh
```

As of now, you'll have to pass values as environment variables (though if you're good with
writing bash scripts that use flags instead a PR would brighten my day!). Passing `*` for
both `REPORT_NAME` and `DATE` _should_ get you every report, if that's your thing.
We're currently running a cron task for each publish time (see the [cron example][ce] below).

      var      |               description               | required? | default value
---------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------|---------------
`OCLC_SYMBOL`  | your institution's OCLC registry symbol |    yes    | -
`REPORT_NAME`  | the report filename (see below)         |    yes    | -
`OUT_PATH`     | where to store the reports              |    no     | current working directory
`DATE`         | date (formatted `YYYYMMDD`) of report   |    no     | today's date
`DEBUG`        | set to `1` to `echo` the command out    |    no     | 0

**Note:** `REPORT_NAME` can contain multiple comma-delimited reports

## Available Reports (as of 2/4/16)
