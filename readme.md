# wms report scripts

While OCLC is phasing out uploading periodic WMS reports to an SFTP server in favor of 
ad-hoc reports building, they do plan to continue uploading circulation add/delete and 
item inventory reports on a weekly basis. After a little bit of setup, these bash 
scripts can be used to automate the transfer from OCLC's SFTP to your own server.
