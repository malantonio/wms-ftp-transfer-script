# wms report scripts

While OCLC is phasing out uploading periodic WMS reports to an SFTP server in favor of 
ad-hoc reports building, they do plan to continue uploading circulation add/delete and 
item inventory reports on a weekly basis. After a little bit of setup, these bash 
scripts can be used to automate the transfer from OCLC's SFTP to your own server.

## setup

You'll want to either use a prexisting public/private keypair or generate one specifically
for gathering reports.

### A) Generate an SSH keypair

```
ssh-keygen
```

**Note:** when creating your keypair, be sure to leave the passphrase blank if you're planning
to automate the report-copying process.

### B) Copy the public file and move it to the SFTP

The SFTP server is quite stripped down as far as what commands can be run (I was only
able to run very basic `ls`, `mkdir`, `rm`, and `chmod` commands, most without the
extra flags needed to accomplish anything worthwhile). I found it easier to make the
changes on my end before placing them on the OCLC server.

```
cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/oclc_authorized_keys
chmod 640 ~/.ssh/oclc_authorized_keys
scp ~/.ssh/oclc_authorized_keys lol@scp.oclc.org:.ssh/authorized_keys
```

**Note:** if you created a separate key, use that name in place of `id_rsa`.

**Another note:** `lol` should be replaced with your library's OCLC symbol.

Enter `yes` to add the SFTP's IP to your list of authorized hosts, then enter your 
password.

### C) Give it a whirl

Try running:

```
sftp lol@scp.oclc.org
```

If it connects without prompting you for a password, you're all set to go!

## usage

```
git clone https://github.com/malantonio/wms-report-scripts
cd wms-report-scripts
```

With the exception of the titles of the files being copied, the two scripts are identical.
(Probably could do to combine them and add another variable / flag). Both accept the 
following environment variables:

      var      |               description               | required? | default value
---------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------|---------------
`OCLC_SYMBOL`  | your institution's OCLC registry symbol |    yes    |
`REPORTS_PATH` | where to store the reports              |    no     | current working directory
`DATE`         | date (formatted `YYYYMMDD`) of report   |    no     | today's date
`DEBUG`        | set to `1` to `echo` the command out    |    no     | 0

## examples

```
OCLC_SYMBOL=lol REPORTS_PATH=/path/to/reports /path/to/scripts/inventory
```

The circulation add/delete and inventory reports are posted at 8am EST every Sunday, so setting 
up a `cron` (on an EST-based server) would look like:

```
0 8 * * 0 OCLC_SYMBOL=lol REPORTS_PATH=/path/to/reports /path/to/scripts/circ-add-delete
0 8 * * 0 OCLC_SYMBOL=lol REPORTS_PATH=/path/to/reports /path/to/scripts/inventory
```
